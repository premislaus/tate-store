# E-commerce Store for the TATE Art Gallery

Design, develop and implement an e-commerce store for the TATE Art Gallery.

You have being approached by the TATE gallery (http://www.tate.org.uk/)to setup an e- commerce store to sell prints of their art collection. 
It should present dynamic views of the collection curated by the Tate gallery.
That is, generated from the collection of data provided, that will present information based on the section of the site the user is interacting with.

 * Provide functionality to list and sell products. (The owner should be able to add new products to his/her store and have them persisted to a database)
 * Thecustomershouldbeabletobrowsetheavailableprintsbyartist,artworkandgenre. (Hint: think routes)
 * He/She should be able to specify the desired quantity of prints for a selected artwork and add the product(s) to their basket upon hitting an “Add to Order” button.
 * The order should be processed by the e-commerce store when the user hits a “Order now” button.
